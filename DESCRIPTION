Description: Build spatially and temporally explicit
    process-based species distribution models, that can include an arbitrary
    number of environmental factors, species and processes including metabolic
    constraints and species interactions. Its focus is simulating populations
    of one or multiple species in a grid based landscape and studying the
    meta-population dynamics and emergent patterns that arise from the
    interaction of species under complex environmental conditions. 'metaRange'
    provides functions for common ecological processes such as
    negative exponential, kernel-based dispersal (see
    Nathan et al. (2012) <doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608898.003.0015>),
    calculation of the environmental suitability based on cardinal values (
    Yin et al. (1995) <doi:10.1016/0168-1923(95)02236-Q>, simplified by
    Yan and Hunt (1999) <doi:10.1006/anbo.1999.0955> see eq: 4), reproduction in form of an
    Ricker model (see Ricker (1954) <doi:10.1139/f54-039> and
    Cabral and Schurr (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00492.x>),
    as well as metabolic scaling based on the metabolic theory of ecology
    (see Brown et al. (2004) <doi:10.1890/03-9000> and
    Brown, Sibly,and Kodric-Brown (2012)
    <doi:10.1002/9781119968535.ch>).
